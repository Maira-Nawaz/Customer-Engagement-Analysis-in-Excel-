#Customer Engagement Analysis in Excel#

I recently completed a **Customer Engagement Analysis** project using **Excel** as part of 365 Data Science’s course. This project focused on analyzing engagement trends among **paid-plan vs. free-plan students** using **descriptive statistics, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing**.  

### 🔍 **Key Findings:**  
✅ **Paid-plan students** showed a **significant increase** in engagement from Q4 2021 to Q4 2022, with the mean watch time rising from **33.80 to 273.02 minutes**. However, increased variability suggests different engagement levels among individuals.  

✅ **Free-plan students** also saw an increase in mean watch time (**25.39 to 117.64 minutes**), but the **median watch time decreased**, indicating that only a subset of students significantly increased engagement.  

✅ **Statistical analysis** (Skewness & Kurtosis) revealed an increasing number of highly engaged students, particularly among paid users. However, engagement among free users remained **highly variable**.  

✅ **Confidence interval analysis** confirmed that paid-plan students consistently watched more content than free-plan students, reinforcing the idea that **monetary investment leads to higher engagement**.  

✅ **Hypothesis testing** validated the difference in engagement between the two groups, highlighting the need for **targeted strategies to improve engagement among free users**.  

💡 **Takeaways:**  
The findings emphasize the importance of **personalized engagement strategies**. Paid users are more likely to stay engaged, but increasing free-plan student engagement could require **more tailored interventions**.  

This project reinforced my **data analysis skills in Excel**—from **pivot tables, statistical functions, and confidence intervals to hypothesis testing**—and deepened my understanding of **customer behavior analysis**.
